Boggle
======

Last week I was asked how I might implement a Boggle solver. After a bit
of thought, I hacked a version in Ruby, then ported it to Windows using
C++ and WTL. The zip includes source for the C++ and Ruby versions, as
well as a prebuilt Windows binary and a substantial word list from YAWL.
Launch from the folder containing the word.list.

By the way, neither implementation handles 'Q' yet.

Windows Prebuilt
================

If you'd just like to try the prebuilt C++ version, it is included in 
**boggle.zip**, not under the prebuilt folder.

I also hacked up an OCaml version that I misplaced - if anyone is
interested, I'll dig around and post it too.
